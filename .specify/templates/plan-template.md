# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Verify compliance with Flight Control Constitution (v1.0.0):

**I. Test-First Development**
- [ ] TDD approach documented: Tests will be written before implementation
- [ ] Test approval process defined: Test files submitted for review before coding begins
- [ ] Contract tests identified for: [list new service interfaces, API changes, shared structures]
- [ ] Integration tests scoped for: [list critical workflows, service boundaries, schema changes]

**II. Code Quality & Standards**
- [ ] Linting verified: `make lint` passes on feature branch
- [ ] Go best practices confirmed: Error handling, import ordering, security considerations documented
- [ ] Interface changes inventoried: [list any interface signature changes with migration plan]
- [ ] Documentation plan: "Why" comments planned for complex logic

**III. Observability**
- [ ] Structured logging plan: Key state transitions and request tracing identified
- [ ] Metrics plan: Request rates, error rates, resource utilization, business metrics defined
- [ ] Tracing plan: Critical paths instrumented (if applicable)

**Complexity Justifications** (complete ONLY if introducing patterns beyond standard practices):

| Potential Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|---------------------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., New abstraction layer] | [specific problem] | [why direct approach insufficient] |

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
